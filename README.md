# IDCLI

A command-line interface for OAuth2 PKCE authentication with Keycloak.

## Installation

### One-line Install
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prefeitura-rio/idcli/main/install.sh | bash
```

### From Source
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/prefeitura-rio/idcli.git
cd idcli

# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Build the project
go build -o idcli
```

### From Release
Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/prefeitura-rio/idcli/releases) and extract the binary for your platform.

## Configuration

Create a configuration file with your OAuth2 settings. You can use `config_example.yaml` as a template:

```bash
# Copy the example config
cp config_example.yaml config.yaml

# Edit the config with your settings
vim config.yaml
```

The configuration file must follow this structure:

```yaml
oauth2:
  issuer: "https://your-keycloak-url/auth/realms/your-realm"
  client_id: "your-client-id"
  client_secret: "your-client-secret"
  redirect_uri: "http://localhost:8000/callback"
  scopes:
    - "openid"
    - "profile"
    - "address"
    - "phone"
    - "roles"
```

The configuration file path must be specified in one of these ways:
1. Command line flag: `--config` or `-c`
2. Environment variable: `IDCLI_CONFIG_YAML_PATH`

## Usage

```bash
# Run with specific config file
./idcli --config /path/to/config.yaml

# Run with config path from environment
export IDCLI_CONFIG_YAML_PATH=/path/to/config.yaml
./idcli
```
